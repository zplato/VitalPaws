        <p>As the bond between humans and their pets continues to
    strengthen, there is an increasing interest in leveraging technology
    to monitor and enhance the well-being of our animal companions.
    This project, VitalPaws, explores the feasibility and effectiveness
    of using smartphone sensors to monitor the respiratory rates of petss
    in real-time. The project aims to develop a user-friendly mobile
    application that utilizes the built-in sensors of modern smartphones
    to measure and track pets' respiratory rates and other vital signs
    accurately. The proposed solution involves placing the smartphone
    on the pet, allowing the smartphone's sensor to capture and analyze
    respiratory movement, which will offer pet owners a convenient
    and non-intrusive method to monitor their pets' health, providing
    insights into respiratory rate variations and potential indicators of
    stress, illness, or abnormal behavior. The collected data will be
    presented through an intuitive interface, allowing users to track
    trends and share valuable information with veterinarians during
    consultations. By utilizing the ubiquity of smartphones, this project
    seeks to empower pet owners with actionable insights into their
    pets' well-being, fostering a proactive approach to pet healthcare in
    the digital age.
